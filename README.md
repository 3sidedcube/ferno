# Ferno ðŸ”¥

Ferno allows you to easily connect your vapor project with your Firebase realtime database. It is built with the brand new Vapor 3. It gives you a nice and clean interface to interact with the Firebase Realtime REST API. It will automatically turn the response into your class/struct! 
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
You will need:
- Vapor 3.0+

### Installing

In your Package.swift file, add the line

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/AAAstorga/firebase-provider.git", from: "1.0.0")
```
Also make sure you add `Ferno` as a dependency

```swift
dependencies: ["Vapor", ..., "Ferno"]
```

## Setup

1. Ferno uses an access token to read and write to your database. First we will need to get a your service account information.

    * Log into the Firebase console
    * Click the settings gear next to `Project Overview`
    * Select `Project settings`
    * Select the `SERVICE ACCOUNTS` tab
    * Click the button at the bottom that says `GENERATE NEW PRIVATE KEY`
    * This will download a `.json` file. You will now have access to the email and private key. You will pass those into the initialize during the next step.

2. Register `Ferno` as a Provider. This is usually done in `configure.swift`

```swift
let fernoConfig = FernoConfig(basePath: "database-url", email: "service-account-email", privateKey: "private-key")
services.register(fernoConfig)
try services.register(FernoProvider())
```

## Parameters
There are some custom parameters to pass into functions. I want to go over all the parameters you will need to know.

### [FernoPath]
In all requests you make, you will see the parameter `appendedPath` with the type `[FernoPath]`.
This paramter allows you to specify where in your Firebase database to execute the request. 

`FernoPath` is an enum with two possible values:
   1. `case child(String)`
   2. `case json`

#### Example
Here is an example database that I will be using.

How would we convert the path `developers->dev-1` to `[FernoPath]`? 

Easy:
```swift
[.child("developers"), .child("dev-1"), .json]
```
And thats it! You usually should always append `.json` to the end of your `[FernoPath]`.

### [FernoQuery]
In GET requests, you might want to query on your data. This is what `[FernoQuery]` is for.

`FernoQuery` is an enum with:
    1. `case shallow(Bool)`
    2. `case orderBy(FirebaseValue)`
    3. `case limitToFirst(FirebaseValue)`
    4. `case limitToLast(FirebaseValue)`
    5. `case startAt(FirebaseValue)`
    6. `case endAt(FirebaseValue)`
    7. `case equalTo(FirebaseValue)`
These are all the possible queries that are allowed on Firebase according to the [docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rest/database/#section-query-parameters)

## Usage
There are 6 functions that allow you to interact with your Firebase realtime database.

### GET
There are two functions that allow you get your data.
   ```swift
   client.ferno.retrieve(...)
   ```
   ```swift
   client.ferno.retrieveMany(...)
   ```
## Testing

Some of the tests written use an actual dummy Firebase realtime database. If you want to run all of the tests, you will need to create a dummy Firebase realtime database. The rest of the tests use a fake client to mimic responses by Firebase.

### Testing Setup

#TODO Explain how to set up tests to run
